   <h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding & Problem-solving</h1>
   <hr>

   <h2>Challenge:</h2>
   <p>For this lab, we had to figure out how to break complicated tasks into small steps that are easy to understand. </p>

   <h2>Problems:</h2>
   <p>The only problem I had while doing this lab was trying to come up with tasks that were interesting and complicated enough to break into several small steps.</p>

   <h2>Results:</h2>
   <div>
      <h3>Putting griptape on a skateboard:</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>Get a skateboard deck, a sheet of griptape, a knife, and a file.</li>
         <li>Start peeling the paper sheet off the back of the griptape.</li>
         <li>Line the griptape up so it covers the entire deck.</li>
         <li>Press the exposed part of the griptape down onto the deck.</li>
         <li>Push the air bubbles in the grip out towards the uncovered part of the deck.</li>
         <li>Keep peeling the paper back off the grip, little by little.</li>
         <li>Repeat steps 4-6 until the deck is covered.</li>
         <li>File the edges of the grip down until there is a clear outline of the deck.</li>
         <li>Cut the excess griptape off the edges of the deck.</li>
         <li>Use the pieces of grip you cut off to sand down the edges of the griptape.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Moving program log files into directories based on their date:</h3>
      <pre>
   //  For each log file in your main log directory:
   //    Extract the month and year from the filename (dd-mm-yyyy)
   //    If folders donâ€™t exist for year/month combo, create them
   //    Move file to its respective directory
      </pre>
